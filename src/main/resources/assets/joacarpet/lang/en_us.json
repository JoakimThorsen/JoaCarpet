  "carpet.rule.insaneBehaviors.desc": "Makes the random velocities of droppers and projectiles (as well as both the position and velocity of blocks broken by pistons) systematically iterate through the most extreme values possible, and then repeatedly iterate through all the halfway points in between, in a sense attempting every point in a 3d/5d \"grid\" that slowly increases in resolution.\nFor droppers and projectiles, this setting determines whether the max value corresponds to the old gaussian randomness limits (\"extreme\"), or the limits of the triangular randomness introduced in 1.19 (\"sensible\"). Both settings function the same for blocks being broken by pistons.\nFor the `/insanebehaviors <reset/getstate/setstate>` command, see `/carpet commandInsaneBehaviors`.\nDo note that insaneBehaviors works on a global iterator: any triggering event will step through an iteration from all other insaneBehaviors events, too.",
  "carpet.rule.insaneBehaviorsSkipVisitedPoints.desc": "Makes the `insaneBehaviors` rule skip points that coincide with previous resolutions, reducing the overall search space by a fraction that approaches 1/(2^resolution)",
  "carpet.rule.insaneBehaviorsIncrement.desc": "Determines the incrementing behavior of the `insaneBehaviors` rule. If set to `normal`, the counter increments normally until all points of the current resolution have been exhausted, then step to the next resolution.\n`loopCurrentResolution` will instead restart at the beginning of the current resolution.\n`Freeze` will stop both the counter and resolution from incrementing.",
  "carpet.rule.insaneBehaviorsCartYeetingException.desc": "Makes testing cart yeeting possible by disabling one of the two types of item drops (vehicle item and container items), to make the different iterators not interfere with each other.",
  "carpet.rule.commandInsaneBehaviors.desc": "The command used for the `insaneBehaviors` rule.\n\"reset\" sets the `resolution` and `counter` back to the default values. \"getstate\" and \"setstate\" are used to manually read and write the current iteration state.",
  "carpet.rule.commandBlockTickling.desc": "Controls who can use the `/blocktickling` command, which lets you send manual block and/or shape updates to blocks using a feather item. Updates are sent from the block in front of the face you're clicking on. Useful if you're working with budded blocks, with /carpet interactionUpdates off, or with intricarpet's /interaction command.",
  "carpet.rule.disableEndermanGriefing.desc": "Disables enderman griefing.",
  "carpet.rule.disableElytraRockets.desc": "Disables using rockets with elytra.",
  "carpet.rule.verticalRocketsFromStandstill.desc": "Makes rocket flying only activate while standing on the ground, and makes it only propel you upwards. Disables using rockets while already flying.\nOnly works in singleplayer, or with JoaCarpet installed both serverside and clientside.",
  "carpet.rule.verticalRocketPower.desc": "The vertical acceleration power used with the `verticalRocketsFromStandstill` rule."
